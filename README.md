# learnings.log 🧠📓

A personal engineering log to **strengthen problem-solving logic**, understand **how code actually works**, and document **real debugging experiences** across multiple languages and frameworks.

This repository is not about showing perfect code —  
it’s about showing **clear thinking, structured reasoning, and continuous improvement**.

---

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

As a student developer, I realized that:
- Syntax is easy
- **Logic is hard**
- Debugging is where real learning happens

So I started maintaining this log to:
- break problems into first principles
- write reasoning before writing code
- document mistakes and misconceptions
- build strong foundations across languages

## 🛠 Languages Covered

- ✅ JavaScript (actively maintained)
- ⏳ C (planned)
- ⏳ Python (planned)
